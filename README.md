# Titanic Dataset Analysis - AI & ML Task

This repository contains code developed as part of **Task 2** of the AI & Machine Learning internship project. The objective is to perform data analysis and gain insights from the Titanic dataset using Python.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information such as age, fare, class, sex, and survival status.

## Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key statistical features
- Identify patterns or trends in the data
- Make basic inferences using visual tools

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Key Steps Performed
1. **Data Import and Inspection**  
   Loaded the Titanic dataset using `pandas` and previewed the structure.

2. **Statistical Summary**  
   Basic statistics such as mean, median, and value counts were used to understand the distribution of numerical and categorical features.

3. **Visualization**  
   Created visual plots such as:
   - Histograms for feature distribution
   - Boxplots for detecting outliers
   - Correlation heatmaps and pairplots for understanding relationships between features

4. **Pattern Detection**  
   Observed survival rates across different passenger classes, age groups, and genders.

5. **Feature-level Insights**  
   Derived inferences from plots to identify trends like:
   - Higher survival rate among females
   - Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival

## Results & Insights
The analysis highlights the importance of gender and passenger class in survival prediction. The dataset shows distinct trends which could be further used for building machine learning models.
